# Chatbot Builder for Frappe and ERPNext

## Introduction

With the **Chatbot Builder**, organizations can easily automate responses to time-consuming and frequently asked questions. The process is simple: 

1. **Identify Common Questions**: List the repetitive questions that your team handles.
2. **Create Reply Templates**: Design templates with variables to customize responses.
3. **Connect Server Scripts**: Link each template to a server script that processes the response.

Thatâ€™s it! The chatbot is ready to handle user queries. Users are identified by their username or phone number, and responses are personalized based on the template and server script combination.

## Supported Platforms

Currently, the chatbot integrates with **Telegram (TG)**, with support for **WhatsApp** and **Slack** coming soon.

## Chat Flow

You can visualize the chatbot conversation as a tree structure. Each branch represents a conversation, starting from the root (initial question) to the leaf (final response). Each node in the tree is a message linked to a template, which may contain variables. These variables are filled using custom functions or server scripts, making each conversation dynamic and interactive.
